Step 1:Create and open chef repository:
mkdir ~/chef-repo
cd ~/chef-repo

Step 2: Create a Web Server Recipe file:webserver.rb(contains package,service and resource).
package 'httpd'
service 'httpd' do
  action [:start, :enable]
end
template '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  source 'index.html.erb'
end
service 'iptables' do
  action :stop
end

Apply the ruby script : sudo chef-apply webserver.rb

Step 3:Create a cookbook:
     
   Create and open the cookbook directory-
          mkdir cookbooks
          cd    cookbooks
    Create a new cookbook and obtain the tree listing
          chef generate cookbook learn_chef_httpd
           tree
    Add the homepage to the index and view the tree listing
        chef generate template learn_chef_httpd index.html
        tree

Step 4 :Homepage resource has to be externally linked:index.html.erb.

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </body>
</html>
          sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist 'recipe[learn_chef_httpd]'
The first web server is brought running
Step 5:Configure another server from your workstation:
           
Install the Chef Development Kit
Sign up for hosted Chef-From your workstation, just fill out the form on our sign-up page.

Install the Starter Kit-save chef-starter.zip and add it to the  ~/chef-repo directory

Get the Apache cookbook

Chef Supermarket is a place for the community to share cookbooks. Chef Supermarket contains the Apache web server cookbook for you to download.Chef server gives you a persistent location to store your cookbooks and information about your servers. The knife command enables you to communicate with the Chef server.

From your ~/chef-repo directory, run these commands to download the web server cookbook from Supermarket and extract it.

knife cookbook site download learn_chef_httpd
tar -zxvf learn_chef_httpd-0.1.0.tar.gz -C cookbooks


Upload your cookbook to the Chef server
knife cookbook upload learn_chef_httpd

Step 6: Bootstrap your node
From your workstation, run this command to bootstrap your node. Replace {{address}} with your server's external address,{{user}} with your username, and {{password}} with your password.

knife bootstrap {{address}} --ssh-user {{user}} --ssh-password '{{password}}' \ --sudo --use-sudo-password --node-name node1 \ --run-list 'recipe[learn_chef_httpd]'

Your node was associated with your hosted Chef account. To verify this, navigate to the Chef management console. From the Nodes tab, you'll see an entry for the node you just bootstrapped.

knife node list

knife node show node1


Step 7: Your node did an initial check in with the Chef server and ran the web server cookbook. To verify this, open a web browser from your workstation and navigate to your web server.
